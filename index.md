Hey! Here's an example of Jekyll Slideshow. Coming right up is a list of differently sized images. Jekyll Slideshow will create thumbnails for them all, and then set up a lovely little slideshow. Hooray!

* ![Example image](/images/300.jpg)
* ![Example image](/images/420.jpg)
* ![Example image](/images/600.jpg)
* ![Example image](/images/an-image.jpg)
